# ü§ñ Robotic Arm ‚Äì 6 DoF
## üìå Project Description
This project features a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) programmable robotic arm designed to introduce foundational concepts in **automation and control**. Inspired by the _**biomechanics of a human arm**_, this robotic arm provides six independent axes of motion‚Äîthree rotational (**roll, pitch, yaw**) and **three translational**‚Äîallowing the gripper end-effector to **orient and position** itself at any point in 3D space.

The six key segments of the robotic arm include:
* **Base**
* **Shoulder**
* **Forearm**
* **Wrist Roll**
* **Wrist Pitch**
* **Gripper**

This prototype model is manually controlled using **three PS2 joystick modules**, each responsible for two degrees of freedom, embedded in a **handcrafted control unit**.<br>
The arm employs two types of servo motors‚Äî**SG90** and **MG995** (three each). While not high-torque, these motors are well-suited for lightweight manipulation tasks, making the setup ideal for testing, learning, and proof-of-concept applications.<br>
At its core, the system uses an **Arduino UNO R3** to process control signals via a **polling algorithm**. The algorithm maps joystick input linearly to joint movement and incorporates a **deadzone** to filter out accidental or sudden joystick releases, ensuring smoother and more stable operation.
